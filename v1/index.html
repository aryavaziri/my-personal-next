              During my studies in Textile Engineering at Isfahan University of
              Technology, I had the opportunity to gain valuable industry
              experience. I worked part-time as a trainee at Diba Control, where
              I delved into the field of industrial electricity and automation
              systems. This hands-on experience provided me with a practical
              understanding of these systems and deepened my knowledge of how
              industrial machines operate. Subsequently, in June 2008, I
              embarked on an internship at Alvan Naghsh Pood fabric dyeing
              factory. I dedicated my summer holidays and weekends during other
              study seasons to this role, allowing me to further develop my
              practical skills and expand my insights into the workings of
              industrial machinery. These experiences have been instrumental in
              shaping my expertise in the field and have fueled my passion for
              automation and manufacturing processes.

              designer. Together, we pioneered the establishment of the first
              textile manufacturing company in Iran. Our focus was on designing
              and producing various machines essential for the textile
              production process. Notably, we successfully developed and
              implemented innovative machines such as fabric dryer machines,
              balloon squeezer machines, rope opening machines, and fabric
              finish compactors. These machines were introduced for the first
              time in Iran, showcasing our commitment to innovation and
              advancement in the industry. Our achievements extended beyond
              national borders, as we installed our machines in prominent
              textile centers such as Tehran, Isfahan, Yazd, Mashhad, and even
              Peru. This invaluable experience allowed me to deepen my expertise

              of available resources showcases my commitment to continual growth
              and development as an automation engineer.

              Upon completing my military service, I took the initiative to
              establish my own company specializing in high-temperature fabric
              dyeing machinery. From 2019 until May 2021, I successfully
              produced three machines, with each one being fully designed by me.
              I took great pride in ensuring that a majority of the machine's
              components were produced in-house, right from the initial stages
              to the final assembly. This included manufacturing dosage pumps,
              electricity panels, valves, and tanks, among other essential
              parts, within my warehouse. By overseeing the entire production
              process, from start to finish, I was able to maintain a high level
              of quality control and precision. This hands-on approach and
              commitment to self-reliance demonstrate my dedication and passion

              importing valves, thereby reducing costs. Our company specializes
              in manufacturing valves in various sizes, ranging from DN15 to
              DN50. Notably, this specific type of valve was introduced for the
              first time in Iran, showcasing our commitment to local innovation
              and self-sufficiency. By producing these valves domestically, we
              were able to ensure high-quality standards while also contributing
