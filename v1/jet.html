To create the necessary equipment, we utilized 3 tons of stainless steel. The machine comprises a main pump for solution and fabric circulation, along with 2 dosing pumps that transfer chemicals from small tanks to the main tank. Additionally, a reserve tank has been incorporated to reduce water filling time and enable energy recovery during the process.

In order for the polyester fiber to absorb dye effectively, it must reach a temperature of 130 degrees. Therefore, the machine has been designed to withstand pressures of up to 3 bars to prevent the water from boiling. Working alongside a team of four, my responsibilities encompassed the entire project, including design, management, supplier negotiations, and automation.</div>
