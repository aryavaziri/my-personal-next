In this proccess, at the beginning, vacuum pump pulls out air and moisture from the timbers for few hours. Then water and chemicals pump into the tank under 12-13 bars of pressure and remains for 10-12 hours. There is another vacuuming proccess after draining the chemicals to decrease the moisture of treated wood as much as possible. <br>In this project, I was responsible for designing and also automation. I, as a project manager, gave the blueprints to laser cut, roller, and welder. Then I managed to automate the proccess, from zero to hundred, such as building and designing the electricity panel, wiring and cabling, and at the end PLC programming.</div>
