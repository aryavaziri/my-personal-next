                A lot of voices and stories have historically been hidden. They
                are not included in history books or in the stories museums
                tell. The stories they do tell, and how they tell them, are
                heavily influenced by the museum&#039;s values, biases, and
                blind spots. Museums are not transparent about this topic,
                they&#039;re not neutral institutions. Museums like Rijksmuseum
                don&#039;t do enough to show the negative side of the Dutch
                colonial past. They rarely present the perspective of the
                countries the Dutch invaded. Recent efforts might mention some
                aspects of Dutch colonization, but they keep silent about the
                horrific events that happened during that period.

                <em>Reframe</em> is a VR experience that focuses on the Dutch
                occupation of Brazil (1630-1654). It's a poly-narrative that
                sheds light on those hidden voices and untold stories. But it
                does more; it makes us aware of our biases and blind spots by
                raising an interesting question: Might the same institutional
                biases we 'accuse' museums of still be present in some
                unforeseen way, neatly hidden in the systems, frameworks, and
                technology we use – and if so, can<em> Reframe</em> address that
                problem too?

              <h2>Design Proposal: Reframe</h2>
              <p>
                In the VR experience, users will find themselves in front of
                <em>View of Itamaracá Island, Brazil</em> (1637) by Frans Post,
                where they will be able to interact with some elements of the
                painting. They hear a different story than the idyllic one
                created by the Dutch painter. A lot is not being told by him.
                Reframe fills this hiatus.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                It confronts users with a different narrative. While interacting
                with the painting, users hear voice recordings of Brazilians
                with different backgrounds who describe what they see when they
                look at the painting. These personal stories are added to engage
                the user, unlock multiple perspectives, and to get across how
                colonization is still affecting many lives nowadays. It does so
                in a 'strange loop' kind of way as well.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="TextParagraph">
              <h2>Strange loop</h2>
              <p>
                In the same room, nine AI-generated paintings show how deeply
                rooted colonialism and racism still are in today's society and
                system. This new technology that's being developed is built on
                existing frameworks. It learns from the data we've fed the
                system. History forms its own datasets. To tell different
                stories, we need different data.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the experience, users will be asked to share their
                experiences related to colonialism and racism. By collecting
                these stories, new data is being gathered. This way, the
                experience will grow over time. With the current explosion of
                generative AI-design tools in mind, this might prove to be the
                most important part of the experience. For it's one thing to
                prompt AI to 'create a painting in the style of Frans Post', but
                another to unlock these hidden stories.

              <h2>Unity</h2>
              <p>
                As a developer in the Reframe VR project, my primary role was to
                create the immersive experience using Unity. I faced various
                challenges throughout the development process, such as
                implementing locomotion techniques suitable for VR and ensuring
                the experience was user-friendly for our target audience, who
                were not necessarily familiar with gaming or technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using my expertise in C#, I integrated a feedback recording
                system to allow users to share their experiences related to
                colonialism and racism. This functionality enabled us to collect
                valuable user data, which would contribute to the growth and
                evolution of the experience over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                To enhance the immersive nature of the VR experience, I utilized
                3D audio techniques and incorporated an audio player with a
                playlist for each section of the project. This allowed users to
                engage with the narrative and personal stories from different
                perspectives, creating a more impactful and meaningful
                experience.
